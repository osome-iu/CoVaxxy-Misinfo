# Misc. data files

## Files:
- `abbr-name.csv` - a file with two columns (1) US states two-letter abbreviations and (2) their full state names
- `fip_code_lookup.csv` - a file that contains fip codes at the county level as well as state fip codes
- `all-geocodes-v2018-RAW.csv` - the raw version of `fip_code_lookup.csv` that has much more information than we need
